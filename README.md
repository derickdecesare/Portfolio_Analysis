# Portfolio_Analysis
This is an analysis report that uses jupyter labs to compare the performance of different hedge funds with eachother and the S&P500. This report works by analyzing whale_navs.csv which shows the daily price of four different hedge funds and the S&P500 over a 6 year period. We use quantititive analysis and data visualization to make an informed recomendation on which hedge fund is the best option.
